## Translations

If you are willing to contribute with translations you need to fullfil some requirements:

* You need a [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/verdaccio) account.
* Chose the target language if exist otherwise request to be enabled.

## Source Code Website

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to publish the website, it is based on React. The source code is under the folder

[https://github.com/verdaccio/website/tree/master/website](https://github.com/verdaccio/website/tree/master/website)

Some caveats you need to keep on mind:

* Do not update files in the following folders due are autogenerated by crowding
  * `website/website/translated_docs`  
  * `website/website/versioned_docs`  
  * `website/website/versioned_sidebars`  
  * `website/i18n/!en.json` (only update en.json, the other files are autogenerated)
